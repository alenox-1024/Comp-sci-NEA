Me: Hello, I've read over your E-mail and can surmise that you want a digital simulator of an Enigma Machine

Client: Yes, that's correct

Me: So you'll need a program that can encrypt a message with the same algorithm as the original enigma machine. 

Client: Yes

Me: Great, do you require any other features, such as graphical simulation, or a user interface

Client: I don't really need a graphical simulation, as we have a physical model with a display already, however it does need to be easy to use

Me: So simple a child could use it

Client: Exactly!

Me: OK, I could definitely make that for you, I'll be in touch later with a formal agreement

Client: Grand
